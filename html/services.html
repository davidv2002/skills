                    “John and his crew were very easy to work with and built us a
          fantastic new deck and hot tub. We love it! During the design & build
          phase John was open to new design ideas to incorporate into his plan
          and always took the time to answer my many questions. His crew was
          always polite and cleaned up the site each day before they left. I
          highly recommend them if you are considering a new deck for your
          home.” — Liz O'Brien
